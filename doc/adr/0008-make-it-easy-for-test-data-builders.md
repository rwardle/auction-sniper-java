# 8. make-it-easy for Test Data Builders

Date: 2017-07-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want a fluent interface for generating test data in unit tests.

We don't want to have to create builders from scratch.

## Decision

We will use [make-it-easy](https://github.com/npryce/make-it-easy).

## Consequences

We will have a consistent way of building test data.
