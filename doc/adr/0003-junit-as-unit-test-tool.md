# 3. JUnit as unit test tool

Date: 2017-07-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to unit test the project.

## Decision

We will use [JUnit](http://junit.org/).

## Consequences

JUnit is the standard for unit testing in Java and has good IDE support.

Unit tests must be written in Java which is a verbose language.
