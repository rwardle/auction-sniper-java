# 6. XMPP as Auction protocol

Date: 2017-07-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a protocol to communicate between clients and the Auction server.

## Decision

We will use [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/).

## Consequences

We will need to use a server that supports the XMPP protocol e.g. [Openfire](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/).
