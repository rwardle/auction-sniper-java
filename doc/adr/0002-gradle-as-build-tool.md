# 2. Gradle as build tool

Date: 2017-07-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build the project from the command line.

## Decision

We will use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build the project.

## Consequences

Gradle is well supported by IDEs so developers will be able to build from both the command line and their IDE.
